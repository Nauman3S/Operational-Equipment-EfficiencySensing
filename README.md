## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo contains

- Firmware
- Circuit Diagram
- Detailed instructions

for OEESensing project.



## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your system.


### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the FW.

```
- Arduino IDE
```

### Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

A step by step series that tell you how to get the Firmware and Backend running

#### ESP32 Configuration

You should have Arduino IDE Installed

  1.  Add ESP32 Board to your Arduino IDE
    1. In your Arduino IDE, go to File> Preferences
        Installing ESP32 Add-on in Arduino IDE Windows, Mac OS X, Linux open preferences
    2. Enter ```https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json``` 
        into the ‚ÄúAdditional Board Manager URLs‚Äù field then, click the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button:
        Note: if you already have the ESP32 boards URL, you can separate the URLs with a comma(each board will go to neaw line) as follows:
        ```https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json,\n http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json```
    
    
  2. Open the Boards Manager. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager‚Ä¶
  3. Search for ESP32 and press install button for the ESP32 by Espressif Systems‚Äú:
  4. That‚Äôs it. It should be installed after a few seconds.
  5.   In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesn't exist yet.
  6.  Unpack the tool into tools directory(present in libs/ESP32FS-1.0.zip) (the path will look like <home_dir>/Arduino/tools/ESP32FS/tool/esp32fs.jar).
  7.  Close and re-open the Arduino IDE.

  8.  Now copy the contents of the libs folder to the libraries directory of your Arduino
      1. If you are using windows, the libraries directory will be Documents/Arduino/libraries

##### ESP32 Node FW Uploading
  1.  Select ESP32 Dev Module from Tools->Board->ESP32
  2.  Select the correct port from Tools->Port
  3.  Then open Firmware.ino file,
  4.  Select Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload menu item. This should start uploading the files into ESP32 flash file system.
  5.  Now Upload the Code to your ESP32 Dev Module.
  6.  Your ESP32 is now ready to be used.

#### SCT-013 

```SCT-013 Connections```

-   Voltage Divider with 2x 100KŒ© resistors.
-   10uF capacitor connected between Voltage Divider Circuit Output and GND
-   3.5mm Audio Jack connected between Voltage Divider Circuit Output and ESP32 Pin 34.

The overall SCT-013 connection assembly will look something like shown in the diagram below.

### Complete Circuit Diagram

Here's the complete circuit diagram of the system.

![CircuitDiagram](Circuit/Circuit_bb.png)

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1.  Power on your ESP32, it will present you with an AP named ```OEE-someID``` (while ```OEE``` can be changed in the portal)
2.  Default captive portal password `12345678AP` which can be changed in captive portal.
3.  Connect to the ESP32 access point and open the web-browser and navigate to the link ```http://esp32.local/_ac```. This link will work on most of the operating systems but if your operating system is not allowing to open it, you may want to check the captive portal IP Address from the serial monitor and can use that IP address inplace of the above mentioned URL.
4.  The default access IP Address is ```http://172.217.28.1/_ac```
5.  You will be presented with a main dashboard as shown below(based on your device)
   ![SCR1](Circuit/scr1.png)

5.  Once connected to a WiFi network, you can again access the captive portal using same URL or the IP Address from the Serial monitor.
6.  The data is published to the MQTT Topic ```OEE/{hostname}``` while the hostname is the one which you can define in Settings page of the captive portal.

The whole system is following the flowchart given below:

   ![flow](Circuit/flow.png)


1.  **Configure New AP** tab allows searching of nearby WiFi APs and adding them to the ESP32.
   ![SCR3](Circuit/scr3.png)
7.  **Open SSIDs** tab allows connecting to the saved access points.
   ![SCR4](Circuit/scr4.png)
8.  **Disconnect** tab allows disconnecting from the connected AP and going into ESP32 WiFi AP mode.
9.  **Reset...** tab allows reseting of the device to factory settings.
    ![SCR5](Circuit/scr5.png)
10. **Settings** tab contains settings related to MQTT and sensors.
    ![SCR6](Circuit/scr6.png)
11. **api-now** tab gives the live-sensor data in JSON format.
    ![SCR7](Circuit/scr7.png)
12. **HOME** tab shows the network connectivity status.
    ![SCR1](Circuit/scr1.png)
13. **LiveSensors** tab shows live values of the sensors.
