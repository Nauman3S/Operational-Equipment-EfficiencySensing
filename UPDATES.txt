1.) Need to be able to set temperature units.
DONE

2.) Need a table of at least some historical data (A row every 5 minutes)
DONE, DETAILS ADDED IN THE README.PDF FILE

3.) Need json access to at least some historical data (A row every 5 minutes)
DONE, DETAILS ADDED IN THE README.PDF FILE

4.) Configure new AP tab should be called "Connect to Wifi"
DONE
COPY THE CONTENTS OF "libs" FOLDER AGAIN TO THE "libraries" DIRECTORY OF YOUR ARDUINO TO REPLACE THE OLD LIBRARIES WITH THE MODIFIED ONES.

5.) OPEN SSID should be called "Saved Wifi Networks"
DONE
COPY THE CONTENTS OF "libs" FOLDER AGAIN TO THE "libraries" DIRECTORY OF YOUR ARDUINO TO REPLACE THE OLD LIBRARIES WITH THE MODIFIED ONES.

6.) Disconnect Wifi really needs a confirmation screen "Are you sure you want to disconnect from "TheConnectedLocalSSIDName"
DONE, NOW DISCONNECT IS REMOVED. YOU CAN CONNECT TO ANY OTHER NETWORK IN "Connect to WiFi" MENU AND IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECT AND CONNECT TO THE NEW NETWORK.

7.) Can you explain how "Both" works with the Minimum Active Value?
"Both" WAS FOR TESTING PURPOSES, REMOVED IT NOW

8.) The actual live sensor value needs to be displayed on the settings page so the user knows what to set the minimum active value to. Vibration or current should be presented as an integer or something so the user can watch their equipment and understand what the minimum active value should be.

9.) I am getting false readings in Watts and Amps without the sensor actually plugged in. Can you have these read zero if the SCT013 isn't actually plugged in?
ESP32 ADC CAN PICKUP ENVIRONMENT NOISE WHEN THE ADC PIN IS FLOATING(NOT CONNECTED TO ANYTHING), TO MAKE IT ZERO, WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE CONNECTED IT TO A SENSOR, CONNECT IT TO GND PIN. NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DONE AS IT IS UNIVERSAL FACT THAT ADC CAN PICKUP NOISE WHEN IN FLOATING STATE UNLESS IT IS CONNECTED TO GND OR SOME OTHER SIGNAL SOURCE.

10.) Can you change it to "Maximum Amps Measured" and just remove watts. We don't always know the user's measured voltage, so watts can't be really know right?
DONE

11.)LED Modes
Quick Blink (200 on / 200 off Milliseconds) - Unit on and equipment is considered “Active”
Slow Blink (200 on / 3000 off Milliseconds) - Unit on and equipment is considered “Idle”
Medium Blink (1000 on / 1000 off Milliseconds) - Wifi not connected, device is in access point mode

DONE, ABOVE MENTIONED SEQUENCE NOW PROGRAMMED. PIN 2 IS NOW BEING USED FOR THE LED WHICH IS ALSO CONNECTED TO THE INTERNAL LED OF THE ESP32, WHEN THE EXTERNAL LED IS CONNECTED, THE INTERAL WILL TURN-OFF ELSE THE INTERNAL LED WILL WORK. I HAVE ALSO UPDATED THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM TO REFLECT THE CHANGES.
